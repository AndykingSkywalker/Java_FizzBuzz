# Java FizzBuzz! All the fun of FizzBuzz in a Java flavour
  Code prints 1 - 100 and checks if the number is divisble by 2 or 5 with no remainders.
> If the number is divisble by both with no remainders it will print "FizzBuzz"
>
> If the number is only divisible by 2 with no remainders it will print "Fizz"
>
> If the number is only divisible by 2 with no remainders it will print "Buzz"
>
> If the number isn't divisible by both numbers with no remainders it will print the number
>
